# Equations and example calculations 

Equation and definition of each indicator are in Table 1 and [Hoban et al (2023)](https://conbio.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/conl.12953). For calculating the Ne>500 indicator for each species, count the number of populations with Ne above 500 and the number with Ne below 500; these two added together should equal the total number of populations **for which data are available**. In the case in which Nc was recorded, estimates of Ne can be obtained by multiplying the Nc value by the Ne/Nc ratio. 0.1 is a conservative default value for all species' Ne/Nc ratio. Instead, a taxon-specific Ne/Nc ratio (either from that species or from a general taxa such as 0.3 for plants) can be used when it is available. 

The Ne>500 indicator can be reported as a proportion (from 0 to 1) of populations with data that are above 500, or in the form of a ratio ‘number of populations above 500’:‘total number of populations.’ Recently extinct populations would have a size of 0 to avoid an increase in the indicator value when populations are lost.

In the case of differing estimates from multiple sources, either the most recent source is used, or a mean of values based on the different sources is taken.
