# Populations maintained indicator

The population maintained (PM) indicator is based on comparing the current number of populations that exist to a prior/ historic assessment of the number of populations. This reflects loss of populations to human-induced changes. 


A count of the number of species with genetic studies available.  Although this does not directly relate to maintenance of genetic diversity or preventing genetic erosion, performing genetic studies and collecting genetic data correlates to management actions designed to manage genetic diversity- such studies help understand needed management actions and to guide them.  So we will also collect information on whether genetic studies exist for species, for indicator 3.  However, this project will not use genetic datasets to calculate the Ne or Nc because reanalysis of data is time prohibitive- we are not downloading and analyzing genetic data.
