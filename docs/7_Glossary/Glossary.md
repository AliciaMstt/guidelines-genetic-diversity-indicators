## Census Size, Nc
The number of reproductively mature individuals in a population. This number can be obtained via physical counts; however, it should be noted that these are not necessarily exact counts, but rather estimates given that the detection probability is dependent on several factors, including population density, observer effort (time) and experience. With that said, census sizes provide a conservative estimate of population size. There are instances where it is impractical or impossible to estimate the size of a population. In such instances, other methods, such as capture-mark-recapture, are extremely effective. 

## Effective population size, Ne
Effective population size is the number of reproductively mature individuals actually contributing to the gene pool. For the purposes of this study, Ne refers to contemporary effective population size which measures ongoing and near-term genetic erosion. Estimating contemporary Ne does not require knowing mutation rates (which is required for estimating historic Ne), but does require demographic knowledge (e.g. census size, Nc, [the number of reproductively mature individuals]; average number of, and variance in, offspring), genetic data (to measure linkage disequilibrium, kinship or genetic drift), OR  a “rule of thumb” to convert Nc to Ne (Frankham 1995; and see Hoban et al. 2020, 2021).

## 50/500 rule 
The 50/500 rule has been used as a guiding principle in conservation for assessing minimum viable effective population size (Ne) (Soule 1980; Franklin 1980). The overall premise behind this rule is that in order for a species or population to persist, a minimum Ne of 50 is needed in the short term to combat inbreeding, while a minimum Ne of 500 in the long term is needed to reduce genetic drift and enhance/promote evolutionary potential in perpetuity.   A recommendation to double these minimum Ne estimates was made, increasing Ne to 100 and 1000 respectively (Frankham et al. 2014). While some have adopted this change, the 50/500 rule remains more widely used. 


## Species distributions

### Wide-ranging (or widespread) species
Wide-ranging species have an extent of occurrence (EOO) greater than 20 000 km2 or are present in more than one-third of a country's 20-km grid squares. 

### Restricted range species
Restricted range species are those that have an EOO <20 000 km2 or an area of occurence (AOO) < 2 000 km2. A list of restricted species has been prepared using KBA criteria and can be found here; however, this list should only be used as a guide as not all species have been assessed. 

### Rare species
Rare species are those that occur in low densities, typically as single individuals or as very small subpopulations with fewer than 50 individuals. They may occur within a restricted range, but are typically scattered over a wide area.
