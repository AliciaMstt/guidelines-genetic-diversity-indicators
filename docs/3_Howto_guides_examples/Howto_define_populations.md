# How to define populations 

A population is a group of individual organisms that can mate with each other  and have low or no connectivity with other populations (see What is a population? section ) . This definition aligns with the IUCN Red List Guidelines definition of a “subpopulation” - geographically or otherwise distinct groups between which there is little demographic or genetic exchange (typically less than one successful migrant individual or gamete per year) [(IUCN 2001)](https://portals.iucn.org/library/sites/library/files/documents/RL-2001-001.pdf). 

In terms of population genetics, genetic differences mostly arise as a product of spatial and temporal isolation, over time due to random processes (genetic drift), and as an effect of population size. Populations separated by more time can have more differences. Designation of populations should also consider human induced gene flow (e.g. reintroductions, translocations). 

Many species’ populations are fairly easy to designate: a population may consist of a cluster of individuals in a discrete location like an island, lake, river catchment or forest preserve, separated from other discrete locations.  

Based on the knowledge of biodiversity and taxonomic experts, definitions of populations will be available in s biodiversity databases, published reports, or expert consultations.  Some judgment may be required in interpreting population designation in a report, but in general the designation of a population by local experts should be considered strongly.  In other cases, the reports or databases may not clearly designate population boundaries and will require interpretation.  Visual examination of maps may result in ‘merging’ occurrences that are likely to experience extensive gene flow (i.e., within the dispersal distance of the species, lack of clear barriers such as a mountain, fence, river).

There are different methods for determining if a population is distinct, and one or more methods can be used (short definitions are given followed by more detail below).

{: .important } 
Methods to define population can be combined. For instance, populations can be defined using geographic boundaries and traits, or genetic differences and ecological or biogeographic proxies.

* **Geographic boundaries**: 

* **Dispersal buffer**: 

* **Ecological or biogeographic proxies**:

* **Traits**:

* **Genetic differences/clades/groups**:

* **Evolutionary significant units (ESUs)**:

* **Management Units** (demography/ migration):

## Metapopulations and when locations change over time

A population may constitute a metapopulation consisting of numerous small localities (ponds, prairies, etc.) that are separate but not very far (hundreds of meters to several kilometers, depending on the species dispersal capacity), thus capable of exchanging at least 1 migrant (one reproductive adult moving between patches) on average per generation per year. In such cases, the population size should be considered the sum of the individual locations (termed subpopulations), which may cover tens or hundreds of kilometers.  

Metapopulations should represent stable spatial and temporal units. Many species have ephemeral subpopulations in dynamic source-sink metapopulations- a sink is a spatial location receiving high immigration from adjacent areas and which would not persist on its own without immigration. Sinks are not distinct populations. The conglomerate of connected subpopulations that should be evaluated as a population.
