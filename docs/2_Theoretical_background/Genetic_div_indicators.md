# Genetic diversity and indicators

Genetic diversity is variation at the DNA level, and includes differences among individuals *within populations of species*, as well as differences *among populations of species*. 

**Within populations:** The diversity within populations within a species helps that population adapt quickly to changing conditions, avoid inbreeding problems, and persist when environmental disturbances happen.

**Among populations:** The diversity among populations within a species is critical for ensuring the adaptive potential of that species, e.g. to a range of environmental conditions. Loss of any unique, genetically distinct population can compromise a species’ ability to adapt to change (both anthropogenic or environmental).

It is therefore imperative that all populations be maintained, and that populations are sufficiently large to maintain genetic health. Based on these fundamental premises, we can assess and monitor genetic diversity not only using genetic data, but also by assessing loss of populations and population sizes relative to Ne 500 -monitoring the process that affects genetic diversity. The genetic diversity indicators adopted at COP15 by the Global Biodiversity Framework are based in these processes.

Genetic diversity is necessary for species’ populations to remain healthy and adapt to environmental change, such as climate change, pollution, changing habitats, and pests and disease. Genetic diversity is also vital for resilience of all ecosystems, such as recovery from heat waves and ocean pollution or acidification. It is also vital for the success of ecosystem restoration and the reintroduction of populations and species. Populations with low genetic diversity suffer inbreeding, low viability, and low resilience. Unfortunately, genetic diversity has declined due to habitat loss, fragmentation, overharvest, and other human activities.
