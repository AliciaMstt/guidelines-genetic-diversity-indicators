# How to get the Ne/Nc ratio

A taxon-specific ratio can be obtained in one of several ways: 

1- from recent reviews of the literature that have compiled average values for groups such as mammals, bony fish, annual plants, trees, etc. (see Hoban et al 2020), 
2- from formulas that take into account a speciesâ€™ biological characteristics (especially the male-female sex ratio and the variance in offspring production), or 
3- from published literature on the species or even populations that are the focus of study. For instance, the ratio in large-bodied mammals and in some trees is often closer to 0.3 (thus the minimum Nc would be 1500). 

These are all valid ways of obtaining the ratio.
