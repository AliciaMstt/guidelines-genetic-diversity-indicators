# Genetic diversity and indicators

Genetic diversity is variation at the DNA level, including differences among individuals within populations of species and differences among populations of each species. However, assessing DNA with genetic sequencing technology can be time consuming, and requires substantial funds, skills and technology, making it challenging for large-scale evaluation, particularly in species-rich nations. Fortunately, we can assess genetic status of species and populations via Ne without needing DNA data. This is the fundamental basis of the indicators- to assess genetic status without DNA sequence data. This is very important since relatively few species have DNA-based studies, especially in biodiversity hotspots. As explained in the methodology in this documentation, proxies of demographic and geographic data can approximate the effective population size (Ne) of populations.

In 2020, three genetic diversity indicators were proposed, including the Headline Indicator on Ne 500. They have the following important features (see Hoban et al 2023a, and Hoban et al 2023c):

* are **scientifically valid**, based in core conservation and genetic concepts 
* are **affordable and feasible** with existing data 
* require a moderate to **low time and resource investment**
* leverage diverse data and multiple ways of knowing including local knowledge holders
* often **align with other biodiversity assessments**
* allow for **easy translation into policy and management** of species
* **are applicable and relevant in all countries**, taxonomic groups, and ecosystems (and can be disaggregated to these levels).
* use concepts that are **intuitive or accessible to non-geneticists** (e.g. genetic losses due to small populations and loss of populations).
* are **‘forward compatible’**, meaning they can incorporate new methods that arise

These genetic diversity indicators have multiple practical uses beyond reporting. They will help countries understand and mitigate genetic diversity loss by guiding conservation action, improve allocation of resources, and communicate to the public about genetic threats to flagship species. Also, genetic diversity indicators highlight how local populations provide adaptation and resilience, which facilitates empowerment and leverage for local communities and indigenous peoples. They are useful under other legislation including national level species protections.
