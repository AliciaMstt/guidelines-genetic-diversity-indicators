# Recommended minimum data and metadata variables for calculating genetic diversity indicators

This section outlines the minimum data needed to calculate the genetic diversity indicators for a particular species within a country (Table 1), as well as additional metadata variables that are optional though can be useful for reproducibility, traceability and analyses (Table 2). 

Data for each variable can be recorded using any tool (e.g. Excel, scripts for extracting data from existing databases), but you can also use the user-friendly Kobotoolbox described above. Thus for each variable, we also provide the name of that variable in the Kobo form, for anyone not using the Kobo form. Using this name for the variables is also needed for the R processing scripts to run accordingly, thus, we suggest using the following variable names if the provided scripts would be used. 

{: .note }
Although the taxonomic information of the species is necessary to gather data and perform the assessment of the genetic diversity indicators, for public reports it is possible to obscure the taxonomic information in cases where making this information public could harm the species conservation. In fact, none of the information collected is required to be made public.
